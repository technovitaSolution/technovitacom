# Closing Fees Calculation (Based on Product Price)

Closing Fee is charged every time your product is sold on Amazon, based on the **price range** of the product.

This fee also varies based on the **fulfillment channel** you are using.

### How to Calculate Closing Fees?

**FC Closing Fees**

`Total Closing Fees = Fees based on item price & category`

- Example 1: Selling **Books** at ₹200 → (Books category is in ₹0-300 exception list) → Closing Fees = **₹12**
- Example 2: Selling **Speaker** at ₹450 → (Speaker category is not in ₹301-500 exception list) → Closing Fees = **₹20**

**Easy Ship & Self Ship Closing Fees**

`Total Closing Fees = Fees based on item price`

- Example 1: Selling **Books** at ₹200 with Easy Ship → Closing Fees = **₹5**
- Example 2: Selling **Speaker** at ₹450 through Self Ship → Closing Fees = **₹35**

# Weight Handling Fees (Shipping Fees) Calculation

If you use **Easy Ship** or **Fulfillment by Amazon (FC)**, Amazon will deliver your products to the customer and charge you a fee.

(If you are choosing to **Self-Ship**, you will have to bear the cost of shipping and deliver through a 3rd party courier service or your own delivery agents).

---

## How to Calculate Shipping Fees?

**FC & Easy Ship Shipping Fees**

**Formula:Total Shipping Fees = Fees based on item weight (refer size guidelines below) + Distance (refer shipping regions below)**

Examples:

- **Example 1:**
    
    If an item (containing a book) weighing **700 gms** is shipped from **Delhi to Chandigarh**
    
    (same region, but different city → *Regional shipping*) through **FC**, then:
    
    **Shipping or Weight handling Fees = ₹54**
    
- **Example 2:**
    
    If an item weighing **3.5 kg** (containing an electronic item) is shipped by **Easy Ship**, then:
    
    **Flat Shipping fees = ₹122 + (₹34 + ₹17) = ₹173**
    
- **Example 3:**
    
    If an item weighing **19 kg** (containing a chimney → *Heavy and Bulky item*) is shipped from a **Bangalore warehouse**
    
    to a customer address in the **same city (Local shipping)**, using **Easy Ship**, then:
    
    **Shipping fees = ₹192 + (₹5 × 7) = ₹227**
    

---

## Self-Ship Fees

For **Self-ship**, there is **no shipping fee levied by [Amazon.in](http://amazon.in/)**

as you will have to take care of delivery yourself or with the help of a courier partner,

who you will pay directly for the cost of delivery.

---

## Shipping Distance Categories

- **Local Rate** → Applicable where the pickup and delivery happen in the **same city** (*intra-city*).
- **Regional Rate** → Applicable if shipment moves **within the same region**, but not within the same city.
- **National Rate** → Applicable if shipment moves **across regions**.

---

**List of shipping regions:**

- Region 1 - (Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh - Zone A*** and Uttarakhand).
- Region 2 - (Dadar and Nagar, Diu and Daman, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra)
- Region 3 - (Andaman and Nicobar, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Lakshadweep).
- Region 4 - (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh-Zone B**, West Bengal).
- *Uttar Pradesh-Zone B: The following administrative divisions will be considered as part of Uttar Pradesh-Zone B - Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Basti, Devipatan, Gorakhpur, Mirzapur, Prayagraj and Varanasi.*
- ***Uttar Pradesh-Zone A**: All administrative divisions in the state of Uttar Pradesh that are not part of Uttar Pradesh-Zone B.*

The product size classification depends on the product weight and length, width & height once packed:

**Size Guidelines**

- Your products will be classified as either Standard or Heavy Bulky.
- An item is classified as 'Heavy & Bulky' if it meets one or more of the following criteria:Item from categories such as washing machines, refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave, chimney, dishwashers, television, treadmills, cycles (wheel diameter > 20”), large furniture (e.g. beds, sofa sets, wardrobes etc.), deep freezers, orItem package weight is more than 22.5 kg orMaximum (item package length, item package width, item package height) > 72” or 183 cm orGirth > 118” or 300 cm #Girth = [Length + 2*(Width + Height)]Multi box items or Items requiring carpenter installation (non DIY)
- For standard-size items, the minimum chargeable weight is 500 gms. In case of items that weigh more than 500 gms, you will be charged in multiples of the price applicable for each 500 gms. For example, the Amazon Easy Ship Weight-Handling Fees for 800 gms package being shipped to a regional location will amount to INR 68 i.e. INR 51 (charge for first 500 gms) + INR17 (charge for next 500 gms).
- Amazon Shipping Fees is computed on volumetric or actual weight, whichever is higher. Volumetric weight is calculated as Volumetric Weight (kg) = (Length x Breadth x Height)/5000 where LBH are in cm.
