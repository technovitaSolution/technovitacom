          <p>
            The seller onboarding process may vary company to company. At Technovita Solution, we provide ecommerce seller onboarding in 5 simple steps:
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 1 – Once a potential seller connects with us for seller onboarding service, we gather some basic information about his/her business – what he does, in which category the product lies – and ensure that all the required documents to sell on the platform are available. Once this is cleared, we move to Step 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 2 – For each customer, we assign a dedicated onboarding expert. He/she stays in constant touch with the client, collects all the documents required for onboarding, and completes the account creation and KYC process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 3 – Once the onboarding and KYC are done, in this step we list all the products of the seller on the ecommerce platform with proper SEO and keywords for better ranking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 4 – After the product listing, we run marketing campaigns for the client’s products to get initial traction and visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 5 – In this last step, we provide training to the seller so that he/she can manage their own account if they want to.
